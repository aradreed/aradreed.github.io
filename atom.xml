    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The costs of being a college student are tremendous in both time and money. However, there is the occasional perk for students to take advantage of. One such perk for student developers is being offered by GitHub.</p>

<p>GitHub is offering free tools for developers that can prove their student enrollment by providing either a .edu email, school ID, transcript, or any other reasonable proof of affiliation. <!-- more -->The <a href=https://education.github.com>Student Developer Pack</a> comes with many different and very useful resources for a developer. You can get access to the Atom text editor (which is already free), a free Micro account on GitHub with 5 private repositories, a .me domain from namecheap free for one year, a Screenhero account, a student plan from SendGrid (15,000 free emails/month), and a lot more! If you&rsquo;re a game developer, you can also get Unreal Engine 4 for free!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a student developer, make sure that you don&rsquo;t miss out on these rare perks. Take these tools and make something cool!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my new website! I&rsquo;m Arad Reed, a current first-year in Computer Science at the University of California - Santa Barbara. Originally from southwest Missouri, I&rsquo;m trying to leave an impression in many places. <!-- more --></p>

<p>I am a passionate programmer and overall tech enthusiast. I&rsquo;ve developed in many different languages and for a variety of platforms. On my <a href="http://aradreed.me/projects/">projects page</a>, you can see some of what I&rsquo;ve worked on. The list includes iOS devices, Android devices, Windows computers, and the Pebble smartwatch. Some of my favorite programming languages include Ruby, C++, and Objective - C.</p>

<p>My most favorite hobby would have to be playing and collecting video games. I generally prefer playing Nintendo games; however, I also play some games for PlayStation. Some of my favorite franchises are Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Uncharted, and God of War. I own many different gaming devices, especially from Nintendo. The NES, SNES, GameCube, Wii, Wii U, many variations of the GameBoy, and the 3DS are just some of the devices I have.</p>

<p>I also used to enjoy solving cubes, such as the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube. I don&rsquo;t do it much anymore, and I&rsquo;ve forgotten a lot about solving the bigger cubes. I went to a competition once, and my official records can be viewed from <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2012REED01">my page on the World Cube Association</a>. I even made a Windows program that would show the different last layer case of a 2x2 or 3x3 cube and the algorithm to solve it from there.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for reading and visiting my site! Like nearly all projects, it&rsquo;s a constant work in progress.</p>
