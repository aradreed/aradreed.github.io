Hey, my name is Arad Reed. Currently, I'm a first-year student studying Computer Science at the University of California - Santa Barbara. I'm a passionate software developer, and I tend to work with languages such as C++, Objective - C, Java, and Ruby. I develop with whatever technology I can get my hands on at the moment. I started out creating simple computer programs, but now I've released apps for both Android and iOS devices, as well as the Pebble smartwatch.
