Hi, my name is Arad Reed. Here, I'll be hosting my blog, where I try to share any informative or interesting tidbits I come across. Currently, I'm a second-year student studying Computer Science at the University of California - Santa Barbara. I'm a passionate software developer, and I tend to work with languages such as C++, Objective-C, Java, and Ruby. I develop with whatever technology I can get my hands on at the moment. To see some of my work, take a look at my website <a href="http://www.aradreed.com">aradreed.com</a>.
