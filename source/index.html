Hey, my name is Arad Reed. Currently, I'm a second-year student studying Computer Science at the University of California - Santa Barbara. I'm a passionate software developer, and I tend to work with languages such as C++, Objective-C, Java, and Ruby. I develop with whatever technology I can get my hands on at the moment. I started out creating simple computer programs, but now I've released apps for both Android and iOS devices, as well as the Pebble smartwatch. Click on the projects link in the navigation bar to see a sample of what I've worked on.
