A few months ago, Nintendo released figures, called amiibo, to be used with some of their popular games using the Wii U's built-in NFC (Near-Field Communication). With a peripheral planned to be released for the 3DS this spring, it will soon be compatible with the figures as well. <!-- more -->

These figures can be used in multiple games with more planned for the future as well. Right now, their main use is for training to fight in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. 

Currently, Nintendo has released 18 amiibo in a set of two different waves (12 the first wave and 6 in the second wave). Wave 1 consisted of Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, Fox, Donkey Kong, Pikachu, Peach, Marth, Yoshi, Villager, and Wii Fit Trainer. Wave 2 had Diddy Kong, Zelda, Luigi, Captain Falcon, Pit, and Little Mac. 

I had originally planned to try collecting all of the amiibo, but it seems to be near impossible to do that now without spending more money than I deem it to be worth. Marth, Villager, and Wii Fit Trainer (also known as "The Holy Trinity") are the hardest ones to get and together go up past $200 on eBay. I currently have 14 of them (missing Marth, Villager, Wii Fit Trainer, and Little Mac). 

It was no surprise that amiibo became highly popular, but I didn't expect the demand to be so high, and I definitely didn't expect the supply to be so low. Virtually every store in the United States is out of stock on Marth, Villager, Wii Fit Trainer, Little Mac, Pit, Captain Falcon, and others that occasionally go in and out of stock. They can be found from foreign sites, but the cost is a little higher, and that isn't very helpful if you're collecting in box as I am (though I do open my favorites if I have a spare). 

Nintendo's next wave is set to come out sometime in February, and I've made sure to preorder all the non-exclusive amiibo (I was too late to grab any of the exclusives). I've given up my fruitless attempt to collect them all, but I'm still going to get as many as I can (at a reasonable price).
