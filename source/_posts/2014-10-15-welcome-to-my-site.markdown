Welcome to my new website! I'm Arad Reed, a current first-year in Computer Science at the University of California - Santa Barbara. Originally from southwest Missouri, I'm trying to leave an impression in many places. <!-- more -->

I am a passionate programmer and overall tech enthusiast. I've developed in many different languages and for a variety of platforms. On my <a href="{{ root_url }}/projects/">projects page</a>, you can see some of what I've worked on. The list includes iOS devices, Android devices, Windows computers, and the Pebble smartwatch. Some of my favorite programming languages include Ruby, C++, and Objective - C. 

My most favorite hobby would have to be playing and collecting video games. I generally prefer playing Nintendo games; however, I also play some games for PlayStation. Some of my favorite franchises are Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Uncharted, and God of War. I own many different gaming devices, especially from Nintendo. The NES, SNES, GameCube, Wii, Wii U, many variations of the GameBoy, and the 3DS are just some of the devices I have.

I also used to enjoy solving cubes, such as the Rubik's Cube. I don't do it much anymore, and I've forgotten a lot about solving the bigger cubes. I went to a competition once, and my official records can be viewed from <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2012REED01">my page on the World Cube Association</a>. I even made a Windows program that would show the different last layer case of a 2x2 or 3x3 cube and the algorithm to solve it from there.

Again, thanks for reading and visiting my site! Like nearly all projects, it's a constant work in progress.
