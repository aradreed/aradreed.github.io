I just recently finished up lesson 3 of the 3D modeling tutorials I've been trudging through. With finals this week (and my sudden urge to play a lot more video games), my progress has been a little slow. Hopefully, I can jump up to a much quicker pace when I go home for the winter break this Friday. Lesson 3 had me creating both a shark and a sword as the projects. You can see my work on these in the images below. <!-- more -->

Below is my work on the shark model. I think it came out pretty well.

Now, my sword model.

I thoroughly enjoyed this lesson and can tell that I'm already improving quite a bit. I've also started working on creating 3D models on my own for objects that I'm familiar with. Those will be posted later when I gather up enough of them to warrant a post.
