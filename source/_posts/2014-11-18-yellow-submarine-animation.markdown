Recently, I've started learning 3D animation using Blender. My first lesson is now complete, and I'm excited about continuing through the lessons. The project for the first lesson was to build the famous yellow submarine, as seen on the Beatles album. <!-- more -->

I really enjoyed working on this project, but it definitely took quite a bit of time. I took screenshots as I made progress, and I've posted the finished animation on Youtube. Below are my screenshots, and I've embedded the completed animation at the bottom.

And here is the finished animation! Sure was a lot of work for just 5 seconds of video.
