Nintendo's popular loyalty program will be shutting down later this year to make room for something new (I'm excited to find out what it will be like). To help current members spend their unused coins, a bunch of new rewards have been put up on the site, both physical and digital ones. <!-- more -->

Yesterday, Club Nintendo put up a good amount of new rewards. Some of the top new physical rewards to grab are Animal Crossing Mini Playing Cards (600), a 3DS XL Pouch: The Legend of Zelda (600), a Super Smash Bros. 3 Poster Set v2 (700), a retro Mario T-shirt (700), a Limited Edition 2013 Platinum Poster Set consisting of Luigi, Zelda Wind Waker, and Pikmin posters (700), the first version of the Super Smash Bros 3 Poster Set (700), a Fierce Deity Link Jigsaw Puzzle (800), and a Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D Messenger Bag (800). 

For Club Nintendo, those are some pretty nice physical rewards to end the program with. But Nintendo also put up a huge offering of digital games as well. The list is huge, so I won't mention them all, but a lot of their greatest games can be bought there. Some examples are Super Metroid, EarthBound, many Mario games, The Wonderful 101, Wii Fit U, some great Zelda games, Super Smash Bros., Kid Icarus, Punch-out, Donkey Kong, and a lot more that are both old and new.

I had 715 coins left on my account, and I have been waiting for a few months until a Zelda item would be released (I knew it would because of Majora's Mask). I check the website nearly daily (I even made a Ruby script to do it automatically) and I knew when the site said it was down for maintenance, some new rewards were being posted. Little did I know at that moment that the site wasn't down for maintenance, it was just receiving so much traffic that it couldn't load (the site seems to be doing just fine today though). After persistent refreshing, I was finally able to log in and claim my reward, the Limited Edition 2014 Platinum Poster Set. My thoughts were between that and the Super Smash Bros v2, but that nice Wind Waker poster settled it. Coins well-spent. 

If you have any coins left to spend, now is the time to do it! Any games unregistered, register them now and grab something! Games released now will no longer have Club Nintendo codes in them, so the chance to get more has passed. 

P.S. In other related news, the Flipnode Studio 3D download code is supposed to come out later this week.
