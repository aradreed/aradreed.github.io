I haven't had a lot of time to work on my personal projects lately, and I imagine that I'll have even less time soon with finals coming up. However, I had an extreme urge to create something today, and it's about time I finished up lesson 2 of the Blender tutorials. <!-- more -->

This lesson had me building a simple castle. It was, thankfully, a LOT shorter than building the yellow submarine but still very time-consuming. Below are the screenshots of my progress and the final result at the bottom. No animation this time.
