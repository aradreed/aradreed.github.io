I've been playing Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS for a little while now, and I enjoy it a lot. I am definitely going to get the Wii U version as well, though I may not play it as much because it isn't portable. If you're planning to get Smash Bros. for the Wii U, you can <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=41442366&cp=&parentPage=search" target="_blank">order it from ToysRUs</a> right now and get a free amiibo to go with it! <!-- more -->

This deal is online only. To get the discount, you must add both the Smash Bros. game and the amiibo of your choice to your cart. I think I'm going to stick with the Mario amiibo for now, but they have plenty to chose from. 

Also, if you have the 3DS version and you're getting the Wii U version, don't forget to register them on Club Nintendo! If you register both versions by 1/13/15, you'll get a <a href="http://club2.nintendo.com/smash-promo/" target="_blank">free soundtrack CD</a> (as well as the Club Nintendo coins and both of the great games).
