    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS for a little while now, and I enjoy it a lot. I am definitely going to get the Wii U version as well, though I may not play it as much because it isn&rsquo;t portable. If you&rsquo;re planning to get Smash Bros. for the Wii U, you can <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=41442366&cp=&parentPage=search" target="_blank">order it from ToysRUs</a> right now and get a free amiibo to go with it! <!-- more --></p>

<p><img class="noBorder left" src="/images/posts/10-21-2014/amiibos.jpg" title="Amiibos" ></p>

<p>This deal is online only. To get the discount, you must add both the Smash Bros. game and the amiibo of your choice to your cart. I think I&rsquo;m going to stick with the Mario amiibo for now, but they have plenty to chose from.</p>

<p>Also, if you have the 3DS version and you&rsquo;re getting the Wii U version, don&rsquo;t forget to register them on Club Nintendo! If you register both versions by 1/13/15, you&rsquo;ll get a <a href="http://club2.nintendo.com/smash-promo/" target="_blank">free soundtrack CD</a> (as well as the Club Nintendo coins and both of the great games).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The costs of being a college student are tremendous in both time and money. However, there is the occasional perk for students to take advantage of. One such perk for student developers is being offered by GitHub.</p>

<p>GitHub is offering free tools for developers that can prove their student enrollment by providing either a .edu email, school ID, transcript, or any other reasonable proof of affiliation. <!-- more -->The <a href=https://education.github.com>Student Developer Pack</a> comes with many different and very useful resources for a developer. You can get access to the Atom text editor (which is already free), a free Micro account on GitHub with 5 private repositories, a .me domain from namecheap free for one year, a Screenhero account, a student plan from SendGrid (15,000 free emails/month), and a lot more! If you&rsquo;re a game developer, you can also get Unreal Engine 4 for free!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a student developer, make sure that you don&rsquo;t miss out on these rare perks. Take these tools and make something cool!</p>
