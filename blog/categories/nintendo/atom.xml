    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="noBorder center" src="/images/posts/2-3-2015/rewards.png" title="Club Nintendo Physical Rewards" >
Nintendo&rsquo;s popular loyalty program will be shutting down later this year to make room for something new (I&rsquo;m excited to find out what it will be like). To help current members spend their unused coins, a bunch of new rewards have been put up on the site, both physical and digital ones. <!-- more --></p>

<p>Yesterday, Club Nintendo put up a good amount of new rewards. Some of the top new physical rewards to grab are Animal Crossing Mini Playing Cards (600), a 3DS XL Pouch: The Legend of Zelda (600), a Super Smash Bros. 3 Poster Set v2 (700), a retro Mario T-shirt (700), a Limited Edition 2013 Platinum Poster Set consisting of Luigi, Zelda Wind Waker, and Pikmin posters (700), the first version of the Super Smash Bros 3 Poster Set (700), a Fierce Deity Link Jigsaw Puzzle (800), and a Legend of Zelda: Majora&rsquo;s Mask 3D Messenger Bag (800).</p>

<p>For Club Nintendo, those are some pretty nice physical rewards to end the program with. But Nintendo also put up a huge offering of digital games as well. The list is huge, so I won&rsquo;t mention them all, but a lot of their greatest games can be bought there. Some examples are Super Metroid, EarthBound, many Mario games, The Wonderful 101, Wii Fit U, some great Zelda games, Super Smash Bros., Kid Icarus, Punch-out, Donkey Kong, and a lot more that are both old and new.</p>

<p>I had 715 coins left on my account, and I have been waiting for a few months until a Zelda item would be released (I knew it would because of Majora&rsquo;s Mask). I check the website nearly daily (I even made a Ruby script to do it automatically) and I knew when the site said it was down for maintenance, some new rewards were being posted. Little did I know at that moment that the site wasn&rsquo;t down for maintenance, it was just receiving so much traffic that it couldn&rsquo;t load (the site seems to be doing just fine today though). After persistent refreshing, I was finally able to log in and claim my reward, the Limited Edition 2014 Platinum Poster Set. My thoughts were between that and the Super Smash Bros v2, but that nice Wind Waker poster settled it. Coins well-spent.</p>

<p>If you have any coins left to spend, now is the time to do it! Any games unregistered, register them now and grab something! Games released now will no longer have Club Nintendo codes in them, so the chance to get more has passed.</p>

<p>P.S. In other related news, the Flipnode Studio 3D download code is supposed to come out later this week.</p>

    <id>http://aradreed.me/blog/2015/01/09/amiibo-craze</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="noBorder center" src="/images/posts/1-9-2015/amiibo.jpg" title="Amiibo Wave 1" >
A few months ago, Nintendo released figures, called amiibo, to be used with some of their popular games using the Wii U&rsquo;s built-in NFC (Near-Field Communication). With a peripheral planned to be released for the 3DS this spring, it will soon be compatible with the figures as well. <!-- more --></p>

<p>These figures can be used in multiple games with more planned for the future as well. Right now, their main use is for training to fight in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.</p>

<p>Currently, Nintendo has released 18 amiibo in a set of two different waves (12 the first wave and 6 in the second wave). Wave 1 consisted of Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, Fox, Donkey Kong, Pikachu, Peach, Marth, Yoshi, Villager, and Wii Fit Trainer. Wave 2 had Diddy Kong, Zelda, Luigi, Captain Falcon, Pit, and Little Mac.</p>

<p>I had originally planned to try collecting all of the amiibo, but it seems to be near impossible to do that now without spending more money than I deem it to be worth. Marth, Villager, and Wii Fit Trainer (also known as &ldquo;The Holy Trinity&rdquo;) are the hardest ones to get and together go up past $200 on eBay. I currently have 14 of them (missing Marth, Villager, Wii Fit Trainer, and Little Mac).</p>

<p>It was no surprise that amiibo became highly popular, but I didn&rsquo;t expect the demand to be so high, and I definitely didn&rsquo;t expect the supply to be so low. Virtually every store in the United States is out of stock on Marth, Villager, Wii Fit Trainer, Little Mac, Pit, Captain Falcon, and others that occasionally go in and out of stock. They can be found from foreign sites, but the cost is a little higher, and that isn&rsquo;t very helpful if you&rsquo;re collecting in box as I am (though I do open my favorites if I have a spare).</p>

<p>Nintendo&rsquo;s next wave is set to come out sometime in February, and I&rsquo;ve made sure to preorder all the non-exclusive amiibo (I was too late to grab any of the exclusives). I&rsquo;ve given up my fruitless attempt to collect them all, but I&rsquo;m still going to get as many as I can (at a reasonable price).</p>

    <link href="http://aradreed.me/blog/2014/11/05/november-2014-nintendo-direct/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-05T18:36:55-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://aradreed.me/blog/2014/11/05/november-2014-nintendo-direct</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, there sure was a whole lot of good stuff to hear on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkXmABkDlNE&list=UUGIY_O-8vW4rfX98KlMkvRg">today&rsquo;s Nintendo Direct</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t watched it yet, I highly recommend it. If you just want a basic overview and some thoughts, continue reading. <!-- more --></p>

<p>The very first and most important thing (in my opinion) mentioned in the Nintendo Direct was an official confirmation of a Legend of Zelda Majora&rsquo;s Mask remake for the 3DS! I, as well as many other Zelda fans, have been waiting to hear this news for quite a while now, and I can&rsquo;t wait to play it when it comes out in Spring 2015.</p>

<p><img class="noBorder center" src="/images/posts/11-5-2014/majoras-mask-3d.png" title="Majora&rsquo;s Mask for 3DS" ></p>

<p>Next came Codename: S.T.E.A.M., Nintendo&rsquo;s new turn-based strategy game for the 3DS. I&rsquo;m not generally very interested in turn-based strategy games, but this one did look like it would be a pretty good one.</p>

<p>A little view on Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker followed Codename: S.T.E.A.M. The game looks like it will be a fun game to play while relaxing a little.</p>

<p><img class="noBorder center" src="/images/posts/11-5-2014/mario-kart-8-dlc.jpg" title="Mario Kart 8 DLC" >
Nintendo also spent some time talking about the Mario Kart 8 DLC, which will be available on November 13. The DLC pack will include new courses, karts, and drivers from titles such as Legend of Zelda, F-Zero, and ExciteBike. The new characters will be Link, Tanooki Mario and Cat Peach. Another DLC pack is planned for May 2015, and you can get a discount if you get a combo pack of both. The game will also be amiibo compatible.</p>

<p>Speaking of amiibos, they were mentioned often as well. Some games that will be compatible with these figurines will be Mario Kart 8, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, Hyrule Warriors, Smash Bros. for Wii U, and more to come.</p>

<p>There was a lot more in the Nintendo Direct, including updates on Splatoon, Xenoblade Chronicles X, and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. Again, I highly recommend you watch it, even after reading this short summary (I didn&rsquo;t cover everything). I see an exciting near future for my Nintendo gaming!</p>

    <link href="http://aradreed.me/blog/2014/10/21/super-smash-bros-amiibo-deal/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-21T09:24:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://aradreed.me/blog/2014/10/21/super-smash-bros-amiibo-deal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS for a little while now, and I enjoy it a lot. I am definitely going to get the Wii U version as well, though I may not play it as much because it isn&rsquo;t portable. If you&rsquo;re planning to get Smash Bros. for the Wii U, you can <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=41442366&cp=&parentPage=search" target="_blank">order it from ToysRUs</a> right now and get a free amiibo to go with it! <!-- more --></p>

<p><img class="noBorder left" src="/images/posts/10-21-2014/amiibos.jpg" title="Amiibos" ></p>

<p>This deal is online only. To get the discount, you must add both the Smash Bros. game and the amiibo of your choice to your cart. I think I&rsquo;m going to stick with the Mario amiibo for now, but they have plenty to chose from.</p>

<p>Also, if you have the 3DS version and you&rsquo;re getting the Wii U version, don&rsquo;t forget to register them on Club Nintendo! If you register both versions by 1/13/15, you&rsquo;ll get a <a href="http://club2.nintendo.com/smash-promo/" target="_blank">free soundtrack CD</a> (as well as the Club Nintendo coins and both of the great games).</p>
